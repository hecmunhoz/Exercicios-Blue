Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing!
We're just friends? What are you saying?
Said there's another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

And I was like
Baby, baby, baby, ooh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby, ooh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh
I thought you'd always be mine

For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe, we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream

I'm going down, down, down
And I just can't believe
My first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby, ooh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Baby, baby, baby, ooh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Luda!
When I was thirteen
I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came to between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy

Oh, I starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She make my heart pound
I skip a beat when
I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna
See her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing
Cuz she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking
But I just keep on saying

Baby, baby, baby, ooh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Baby, baby, baby, ooh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

And I was like
Baby, baby, baby, ooh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

I'm gone, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone, I'm gone`);
